# UFOs
## Project Overview 

The goal of this analysis was to create a webpage containing information on UFO sightings around the US. The page has a dynamic table that filters the UFO data by date, city, state, country, and shape. The table updates once the user inputs one or more criteria into one of the five filter boxes.  

 

## Results 

When a user visits the webpage, the table initially will show the UFO data ordered by date. To the left of the table, there are five search boxes (as shown below) where the user can filter the data for a specific date, city, state, country, or UFO shape.

It is up to the user how many criteria they would like to search by. Once they type their criteria into one of the boxes and press enter, the table will filter according to what was entered. With each new entry, the table will continue to filter to show sightings that fit all present criteria. See below for examples of searches:

### Searching by all

As you can see in the images, the filters are dynamic and will populate only the sightings that fit the search criteria. Note that the search criteria needs to be entered the correct way or else the table won’t be filtered properly. The placeholder entries in the boxes show the user the exact format they should use when typing their criteria.    

 

## Summary 

While this UFO webpage is pretty user-friendly with its five dynamic filters, it is not a perfect page. One issue that definitely could arise is we might have users coming up empty when searching for UFO sightings in their city. It could be that they entered something incorrectly (perhaps they capitalized some letters or something) or it could be that the site just doesn’t have any sightings data for that city. Either way, this could result in frustrated users, which is never a good thing. Below are some suggestions for how we might be able to improve the design of the web page to make it even more user-friendly:  

- Perhaps if we reworked the input boxes so that they could return data regardless of capitalization, we could provide a smoother experience.  

- Another idea might be to include drop-down menus on each filter that list all dates, cities, states, countries, and shapes that are present in the data. This way, if a user is having trouble entering their criteria, they can resort to the drop-down menu.  

- Lastly, adding buttons that will both “search” and “reset” the filters might be a good idea as well. Even though the site isn’t too hard to navigate, having clearly labeled buttons to initiate a search and to then clear the search criteria provide a more user-friendly experience. With the buttons, the users can plainly see how to navigate the page rather than having to play around to see what works.
